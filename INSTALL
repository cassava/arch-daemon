ARCH-DAEMON (SHORT: DAEMON) INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
=======================================================================

### Dependancies
  - This program only makes sense on Arch Linux (as far as I know).

### Installation
  - Put `daemon` into `/usr/bin/` and you're good
  - Install Bash-completion support:
    a) Get the Bash completion support from (for the most recent version):
       http://andrwe.org/doku.php/blog/scripting/bash/arch-daemon-completion
    b) Just put `arch-daemon.bash-completion` into `/etc/bash_completion.d`
       as `arch-daemon`. (This should be equivalent to method a.)
       

### Tips
  - Consider making `sudo daemon` without a password, and then make an
    alias `alias daemon="sudo daemon"`. Might save you some time.
