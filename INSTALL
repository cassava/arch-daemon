ARCH-DAEMON (SHORT: DAEMON) INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
=======================================================================

### Dependancies
  - This program only makes sense on Arch Linux (as far as I know).

### Installation
  - Put `daemon` into `/usr/bin/` and you're good
  - Get the Bash completion support from:
    http://andrwe.org/doku.php/blog/scripting/bash/arch-daemon-completion

### Tips
  - Consider making `sudo daemon` without a password, and then make an
    alias `alias daemon="sudo daemon"`. Might save you some time.


Generic Installation Instructions
----------------------------------
**WARNING:** This is a generic guide on how to install this package, it was
not written specifically for this package, but that does not mean that
it is not applicable (for if something weren't, then it would probably
be deleted... hopefully). The fact is, we all hate updating this file,
because we don't ourselves need it, so better something generic that
works than something outdated that trashes (unlikely) your system.

The recommended way to install this is of course to use a package, that
way you avoid doing work ;-) If that cannot however be avoided, here
are a few guidelines which should help you to figure out how to install
this package.

  1. See the Arch Linux `PKGBUILD` for help. The `PKGBUILD` is a file
     which determines exactly how a package is built and where the files go.
     The function `build()` is especially important. If you get this, you
     pretty much have everything you need, unless your system looks
     different.
  
  2. The directory structure in the source often mirrors the way the
     files will be distributed when they are installed.
  
  3. You could use a little intuition if the above two didn't help:
       * binaries go to `/usr/bin`
       * helper libraries or scripts go to `/usr/lib/$package\_name`
       * common resources that aren't part of the program logic go
         to `/usr/share/$package\_name`

That should get you hopefully far enough. Otherwise just send me a
quick message, and I'll see how I can help (see `AUTHORS`).
