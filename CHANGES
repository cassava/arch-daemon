CHANGES: ARCH-DAEMON                                                       2.0
===============================================================================

2.0   (8. January 2011)
  - Rewrote commandline syntax, not backwards compatible.
    Now it looks like this:
        daemon [options] [command] <daemons>
    The commands `start`, `stop`, `restart` and `reload` have the
    aliases `s`, `t`, `r` and `l`.
    See daemon --help or README for more information.

  - Ability to send unknown commands, e.g.
        daemon setup vboxdrv
    If the first argument does not exist as a daemon, then it is assumed
    to be a command. To run a daemon named after one of the aliased commands,
    such as `start`, first set the command with the -c argument:
        daemon -c start start

  - Check if a daemon supports the given command and warn the user.
    As of now, will only fail if the -f fail option is given. 
    Daemon might not be able to determine what the supported commands are,
    so it gives more power to the user and lets you send a command which
    it thinks is not valid (if the -f fail option is not given).

  - Allow listing of available commands for a daemon, e.g.
        daemon -z cups httpd

  - Removed ability to stop and then start daemons. I don't know what this
    was good for anyway.

1.10  (3. January 2011)
  - Support for the `reload` command (e.g. for httpd).
    Syntax is: -rl or --reload

  - Add (improved) bash completion support;
