CHANGES: ARCH-DAEMON                                              2.0
=====================================================================

2.0   (3. January 2011)
  - Rewrote commandline syntax, not backwards compatible.
    Now it looks like this:
        daemon [options] [command] <daemons>
    The commands `start`, `stop`, `restart` and `reload` have the
    aliases `s`, `t`, `r` and `l`.
    See daemon --help or README for more information.
  - Ability to send unknown commands, e.g.
        daemon setup vboxdrv
    If the first argument does not exist as a daemon, then it is assumed
    to be a command. To run a daemon named after one of the aliased commands,
    such as `start`, first set the comman with the -c argument:
        daemon -c start start
  - Check if a daemon supports the given command and warn the user.
    As of now, will only fail if the -f fail option is given. Some scripts
    might not tell you what the usage is, in which case daemon will not
    correctly identify (this is a case of: power to the user!)
  - Allow listing of available commands for a daemon, e.g.
        daemon -z cups httpd

1.10  (3. January 2011)
  - Support for the `reload` command (e.g. for httpd).
    Syntax is: -rl or --reload
  - Add (improved) bash completion support;
