ARCH-DAEMON (SHORT: DAEMON) README
=======================================================================

**Daemon** manipulates services on an Arch Linux system.

For the time being I am too lazy to write up a readme, please see the
help of daemon itself (daemon --help) or look at the source code of
daemon, there you can also read the help.


*TODO: this README will be updated and completed in the next few days.*
